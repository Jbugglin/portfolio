            <h1>A Little about me (working heading):</h1>
            <p>I started out learning frontend web development over the course of a few years, starting back in 2019, the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic. As things were looking bleak, my wife an I were expecting our first child, and I needed something to do to one day make a career out of. Up to this point I have worked in various warehouses and print-shops. I remembered a course that I took while studying at Franklin University, in the Computer Science degree track, that was a course developing a full-stack web site. I had come to really enjoy that class, so I started to learn and dive into developing my own sites. </p>
