Ideas:


Background: I want the bg to correspond with the greeting.

    -color gradients for:
        -morning 
        -afternoon
        -evening
        -night

    -possibly animate the bg to show the sun/moon in relation to the greeting:
        -morning: Sun rising breaking horizon. Samecolors as afternoon but with a touch of sepia.
        -afternoon: Sun At top of page. Vibrant colors.
        -evening: Sun setting on horizon. Oranges/reds/browns/black
        -night: Sun gone and Moon brightly appearing. Darker colors
